# Data Test Attribute Extension

This VSCode extension identifies interactable html elements, such as buttons, that do not have a `data-test` attribute. This helps certain testing software specific to FamilySearch parse through html.

# Install

For the time being, you'll have to get the extension from me or someone who has it.

# Develop

Clone this repository, run `npm install`, and then code away.
